- Create a homepage, info pages, css, links, and accounts
- make the chat window look super cool with fun buttons
- make multiple text message types (a button one for example)
- make a chat history button, make chat default to displaying last 10 messages or something



Demo user input:

- Hi, I think I have covid!
- I have a cough, and my temperature is running a bit high,
- Ok I will head to my closest testing center
