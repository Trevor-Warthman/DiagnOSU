Talking points:

	Hi we are the team developing DiagnOSU a covid chat bot to help you determine
	whether you need to get tested or not. We have created a React app that we have deployed to 
	github pages. We use continuous integration through github actions. We decided to try and
	maximize what we got out of this class by spiting tasks into things each of us have not had
	much experience in and that is why you get to look at my lovely front end  development
	that I learned in 2 week. As for the knowledge system part of the class we used Watson 
	assistant and trained it on some of the serious and less serious symptoms of covid to 
	give a good recommendation for when the user needs to get a test. Im now going to show
	you guys 3 different paths that a user might go through when using the bot.
	
	* do demo here *
	
	In our next iteration we will be ironing out some of the more specific cases and the edge
	cases that our current iteration does not catch. We will also work towards integrating the
	frop down menu to auto fill text so you can look at the drop down and select a symptom you
	are experiencing instead of exiting the drop down and exiting.
